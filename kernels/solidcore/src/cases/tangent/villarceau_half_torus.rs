//! A torus about the z axis, of radii 5 (its tube's middle circle) and 3 (its tube), cut by the
//! bitangent plane 3x - 4z = 0, keeping what lies on and below it, z <= 3x/4: the half-space
//! above is a block reaching past the torus, its bottom face first on the xy plane and then
//! tilted about the y axis until its normal is (-3, 0, 4)/5.
//!
//! solidcore's torus has its seam (the tube's section it was turned from) on its +x side, so it
//! is turned a quarter turn about z first, putting the seam in the plane x = 0 on the side y > 0.
